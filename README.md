# My-Twitter-Dashboard

I have created a Shiny App Dashboard that inputs Tweets for the selected Word or User Handle and peforms various Twitter Analytics on it. 

I have created the project using the R library (rtweet) and other common R libraries.

Using the rtweet library, it is possible to extract upto 5000 tweets for a particular Word/Words, Hashtag or User Handle. 

In the first part, I have peformed basic Analysis on the tweets like the Most Retweeted Tweets, Most Frequent Hashtags, Most Frequent Words and Most Frequent Tweeters for the selected Word or User Handle. 

In the second part, I have performed Sentiment Analysis on the tweets using the R library (syuzhet). 

You can follow along the code in UI.R and Server.R Files.
